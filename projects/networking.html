                    <h3>Purpose</h3>
                    <p class="text">
                        A while ago, a friend and I started working on a personal game project. The game was
                        multiplayer, so we needed a framework to implement networked functionality.
                        Because Unity3D doesn't have a performant networking API and because we wanted great control
                        over structure and optimization, we decided to write our own implementation.
                        Because I like technical stuff, I focused on the API.
                    </p>

            <section class="development">
                <div class="outer-container">
                    <h3>Development process</h3>
                    <p class="text">
                        Our first implementation was not good at all. There were a lot of tight coupled components with
                        large classes and functions, which made extending and testing the API a chore.
                        I started abstracting various components to decouple the whole system. It took a few tries to
                        come up with a clean way to implement the solution. It's very common in Unity game development
                        to work with global state (like global singletons) and it's also really unconvenient to unit
                        test Monobehaviour scripts. That's why I split the API in 2 separate modules: a core module and
                        a unity module.
                        The core module is pure C#: it has no references to the Unity framework and is written with
                        testability in mind. I figured that the data processing side of the API doesn't really have to
                        know where the data comes from,
                        wether it's from GameObjects or some random C# object. The core module contains the logic to
                        serialize and deserialize data, format them as messages and dispatch them to various interfaces.
                        It is very customizable. The unity module implements all necessary logic for gameplay
                        networking. It contains a NetworkComponent, NetworkIdentity, RPC functionality and so on.

                    <p class="text">
                        The project is far from completed. By working according to the SOLID principles, the number of
                        components has increased rapidly.
                        There is a lot of dependency injection going on right now to facilitate communication between
                        various components.
                        I'm playing with the idea of implementing an Event System where the various components can
                        listen for certain events and process them to their liking.
